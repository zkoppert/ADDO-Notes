## Key Points
- Purple Team: Both red team and blue team
- Zero trust
    - Goes beyond defending the perimeter
- Assumed-Breach
    - Similar to Zero Trust
    - Excercises incident response plan
- Serverless Best Practices
    - Serverless should not call other serverless instances
    - Use Secret Stores - no hard coding
    - Deploy functions with minimal granularity/scope
- 3rd Party component security (SCA: Software Supply Chain Security)
    - Scan pipelines as well as code
- Know the value of the data
    - This means document it somewhere
- Lock down the containers via templates
- Throttle the bots
- Verbose error messages can endanger security
- Block web methods not being used, reducing attack surface
