## Tips for Pipelines

#### Your pipeline is a product
- It should have feature releases, planning/roadmap, versioning, backlog
- Pipeline is People, Processes, and Technology

#### Don't duplicate tools
- Adds unnecessary complexity at a company wide view

#### Use an Identity Provider
- Reduces complexity greatly

#### Use Bot accounts instead of personal keys for automation
- Information can be stored securely in a password manager

#### Be very clear about what action needs to occur in notifications
- Don't let notifications and output get ignored

#### Infrastructure as Code
- always, always, always

#### Consider Security when building the pipeline
- Consider DREAD or STRIDE methods
